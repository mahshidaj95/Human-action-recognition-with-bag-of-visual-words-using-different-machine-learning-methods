# Human action recognition with bag of visual words using different machine learning methods
In this project, we implement the proposed method of ISA article in the title of "Human action recognition with bag of visual words using different machine learning methods and hyperparameter optimization" with DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04365-9 

Dataset link: https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/SpaceTimeActions.html 

We implemented this article in below steps:

1. Preprocessing: in this step, we convert image frames in dataset to grayscale and binary image formats.

2. Feature Extraction: using SIFT algorithm

3. Clustering: using K-means clustering.

4. Histogram Creation

5. Machine learning Classification: using KNN method.

6. Improve results: By changing number of features in Feature Extraction step and changing value of K in K-means clustering.
